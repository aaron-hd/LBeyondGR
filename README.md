# LBeyondGR
A simple-to-use Mathematica package to (i) ray trace null geodesics in stationary, axisymmetric, and asymptotically flat spacetimes, (ii) numerical bisect potentially non-star-convex lensing-band boundaries, and (iii) minimize the overlap of the resulting geometric lensing band with an observational prior.
